This was one of my college web projects. I created everything from scratch besides the WinWheel Library.

This project is a for a children's math education game that is meant to be played on a number line with a two pawns/movers and
a handful of coins (preferably of equal value).

This is primarily a showcase of my JavaScript skills, but has some strong HTML and CSS implementation as well.
If I were to continue this project, the number one thing I would fix would be the layout design. It is very lackluster,
especially for a children's game, but it just simply wasn't within the scope of the project at the time.
