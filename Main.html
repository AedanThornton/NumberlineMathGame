                <p>On the bottom of the screen it says which player's turn it is. On your turn, you will be moving in one direction to try and get to your goal,

                <ol> <b>To setup the game</b>
                    <li>One player should choose to be Player 1, and the other will be Player 2. This can be determined randomly if you so choose.</li>
                    <li>Place the mover at <b id="instr_start_pos">X</b> on the number line.</li>

                    <li>Buttons will appear on the screen, click on the one that has the same number as the space you landed on</li>
                    <li>If you clicked the correct button, you get to move <b id="instr_reward_val">1</b> extra spaces towards your goal!</li>
                    <li>If you pass over one of your coins, collect it. On future turns, you get to move <b id="instr_coin_val">X</b> extra spaces towards your goal when selecting correct answers (the total bonus you get will appear on the right side of the screen).</li>
                    <li>Player 1's goal is to get to <b id="player1_goal">X</b>.</li>
